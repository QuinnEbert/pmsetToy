LICENSE for Quinn Ebert's pmset Toy
===================================

+ You are permitted to modify and redistribute the pmsetToy.cli script at no charge (ONLY), so long any all modified and redistributed (or just redistributed) versions bear a comment (which you must place yourself at present) at top mentioning Quinn Ebert and http://www.QuinnEbert.net/ as their original source/author.
+ You MAY NOT charge yourself or any third party any fee (even for coverage of expenses) in relation to this project, or any work you create based on it, for any reason (unless you contact me first and we negotiate and you pay a fee for the privilege).
+ You MAY NOT create programs (CLI, GUI, or otherwise) that leverage pmsetToy.cli in ANY way, without first contacting me, and allowing me to OK it (possibly for a negotiable licensing fee depending on your plans for developing the program--I will likely let you get away with it for free--assuming the program will be free and open source for me to later fork out).
+ Anything else is strictly forbidden (without you contacting me and me OK'ing it first), sorry, I really want some control on this. ;)
